      <td> <a href="https://drexel.edu/dornsife/academics/faculty/Brisa%20Sanchez/">Brisa Sánchez</a> is Dornsife Professor of Biostatistics at Drexel University. She received her Ph.D. in Biostatistics in 2006 from Harvard University. Her research interests are in statistical methodology applicable to environmental epidemiology, and social epidemiology, and health disparities.</td>

      <td><a href="https://www.stat.uci.edu/faculty/veronica-berrocal/">Veronica Berrocal</a> is an Associate Professor of Statistics at the University of California, Irvine. She received her Ph.D. in Statistics from the University of Washington in 2007, working on developing spatial statistical models for probabilistic weather forecasting. Veronica's research focuses on developing and applying statistical models for data collected over space and/or over time. Her main applications are related to: atmospheric sciences (weather and climate data), environmental/social epidemiology (exposure to pollutants, heat, weather, built-environment, etc.), rheumatology, and also some image data.</td>

    <tr>
      <td><div class="thumbwhiteman"></div></td>
      <td> Andrew Whiteman is a current Biostatistics M.S. student at the University of Michigan. He worked with Dr. Sanchez to develop an R software package to fit and interpret distributed lag models based on the work of Dr. Jonggyu Baek. These models can be used by epidemiologists, for example, to infer the spatial extent of relationships between urban features and health outcomes. Andrew's other professional interests include Bayesian statistics and computation, and methods for large and high dimensional data sets, including medical images.</td>

      <td><div class="thumbyuqi"></div></td>
      <td>Yuqi Zhai is a current Biostatistics M.S. student at the University of Michigan. She received her B.S. in Statistics from Peking University in 2016. She worked with Dr. Sanchez to develop an approach based on the simulation-extrapolation (SIMEX) algorithm to quantify and correct the bias in built environment health effect estimates that is introduced due to geocoding errors. Yuqi’s other professional interests include Bayesian methods and missing data analysis. Most recently she has focused on developing methods to account for complex sample design in general Bayesian analyses.</td>
